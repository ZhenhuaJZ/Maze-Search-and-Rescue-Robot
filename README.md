# Maze-Search-and-Rescue-Robot
This repository is for developing search and rescue robot for subject "Mechatronics 2", the code is programmed in MPLAB for PICPIC16F877A microcontroller.

The maze search algorithm we employed is tremaux maze search algorithm. The software is programmed to interface with uart serial communication with iRobot mobile platform.
